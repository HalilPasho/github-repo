## Getting started

- // yarn

- run the app - `yarn start`

- // npm
- Git clone the repo
- npm install inside the project
- npm start

## Implementation

About the app, i got the github Api's and implemented a search button where you can search by name of the repos.
When you search one you will get the repos that include that "key" typed by user.
When you click on a repo then you can see the etails of the repo and a link where you can visit the github page .

For my purposes i used react hooks, async ans sync functions and some commends explaining whats is happening.

Total of 6 components and for styles i used scss.

I had already the function for fetching the data of apis and adopted it according to my needs.
Also the sorting according to name and stars was something i had in my templates.

I didnt install typescript because i started this app very late unfortunetly for family urgent issues, but if you want me to add typescript, anytime if you think its okay we can have a technical interview.

The root api is in the api folder.
